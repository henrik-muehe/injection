SQL Injection Game
==================

Very simplistic task of injecting a malicious statement such as to retrieve the users table. Used in the tutorials of our database systems course at TUM Germany.

	make

generates a basic database from the included SQL file.

	make clean

resets the database and finally

	make run

executes the server.
